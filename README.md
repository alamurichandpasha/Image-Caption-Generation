# Image-Caption-Generation

"An image caption is a textual description that highlights the key details of a picture, such as a photograph. While this task is simple for humans, it is extremely challenging for computers because it requires both understanding the content of the image and expressing that understanding in natural language.
In this project, we will use a CNN (specifically the VGG16 model) and an LSTM to generate captions for images. With the advancement of deep learning techniques, large datasets and powerful computing resources make it possible to create models capable of generating accurate image captions. This Python-based project will implement these deep learning techniques, including CNN and RNN, to achieve this goal."
